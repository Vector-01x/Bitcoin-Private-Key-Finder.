## Bitcoin Private Key Recovery Tool

This tool is designed to recover missing segments of a Bitcoin private key by comparing generated public addresses to a target public address. It's especially useful when part of the private key is missing, enabling you to reconstruct and regain access to your Bitcoin wallet.

### How It Works

The tool accepts a **public Bitcoin address** and attempts to generate the corresponding private key by systematically guessing the missing segments. Once the generated public address matches the target address, the tool identifies the correct private key. This process is done offline to ensure privacy and speed.

Missing key segments are represented as **`?`**


### Getting Started

**Step 1: Download Python 3.10**
Ensure Python 3.10 is installed on your machine. [Download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

**Step 2: Install Required Libraries** Run the following commands in your terminal to install the necessary libraries:

```
    pip install requests
    pip install bitcoin
    pip install colorama
```
**Step 3: (Optional) Set Up Discord Notifications**

To receive a notification once the tool successfully recovers the key, add your **Discord webhook** URL on line **60** of the code. Replace the placeholder ```DISCORD WEBHOOKS```` with your actual webhook URL.

### Notes

-   The tool works offline for security and privacy, making it safe to use.
-   Ensure you are using a valid public Bitcoin address and that the missing key segments are properly marked with **`?`**.

### Notes

-   The tool works **offline** for key recovery, ensuring **security** and **privacy**. The **internet** is used only for sending **Discord notifications** if enabled.
-   Ensure you are using a valid public Bitcoin address and that the missing key segments are properly marked with **`?`**.


The Bitcoin private key recovery tool can be run on **Termux**, a Linux emulator for Android devices. However, you should exercise caution when using it if a large number of segments are missing, as the key recovery process may take a long time in such cases.

The more powerful the device, the faster the search process will be. This means that stronger devices will be able to complete the operation more quickly. However, if a large number of segments are missing, such as 13 or more, the search will take a longer time to complete.

I do not recommend searching for images online that show 13 missing segments, especially if their authenticity has not been verified thoroughly. In some cases, these images may be misleading or inaccurate. Always ensure the data’s validity before attempting recovery, and avoid proceeding with such searches without prior verification.

**Use the tool at your own risk.** ⚠️
