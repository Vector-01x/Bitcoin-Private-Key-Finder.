## Bitcoin Private Key Recovery Tool

This tool is designed to recover missing segments of a Bitcoin private key by comparing generated public addresses to a target public address. It's especially useful when part of the private key is missing, enabling you to reconstruct and regain access to your Bitcoin wallet.

### How It Works

The tool accepts a **public Bitcoin address** and attempts to generate the corresponding private key by systematically guessing the missing segments. Once the generated public address matches the target address, the tool identifies the correct private key. This process is done offline to ensure privacy and speed.

Missing key segments are represented as **`?`**


### Getting Started

**Step 1: Download Python 3.10**
Ensure Python 3.10 is installed on your machine. [Download it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3100/).

**Step 2: Install Required Libraries** Run the following commands in your terminal to install the necessary libraries:

```
    pip install requests
    pip install bitcoin
    pip install colorama
```
**Step 3: (Optional) Set Up Discord Notifications**

To receive a notification once the tool successfully recovers the key, add your **Discord webhook** URL on line **60** of the code. Replace the placeholder ```DISCORD WEBHOOKS```` with your actual webhook URL.
