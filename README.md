This tool is designed to recover missing parts of a Bitcoin private key by comparing generated public addresses to a given target public address. Itâ€™s particularly useful when some segments of a private key are missing, allowing you to restore access by reconstructing the key accurately and efficiently.

**How the Tool Works**
The tool takes in a **public Bitcoin address** and then attempts to generate the correct private key by systematically guessing the missing parts. Once the correct key is identified (by matching the derived public address with the provided target address), the tool completes the key recovery process and displays the results. This entire process works offline, ensuring speed and privacy.
### Getting Started

1.  **Install Required Libraries:**
```
    pip install requests
    pip install bitcoin
    pip install colorama
```

**Setup Discord Notifications (Optional)**

To receive a notification once the tool successfully recovers the key, add your *Discord webhook* on line 60 of the code by replacing `"```DISCORD WEBHOOKS```"` with your webhook URL.
